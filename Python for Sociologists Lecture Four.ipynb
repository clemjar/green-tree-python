    "Perhaps the most important concept that we will cover in this course is the notion of abstraction. To make something more abstract is to articulate or encode some phenomenon in a form that is less contingent or specific. If we can discern the commonalities between different cases, we can apply the same logic in a number of cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The functional purpose of programming is typically to transform particular cases into more general ones. Instead of renaming every photo in a set of vacation photos, we can append \"Vacation2016_\" to all of them. In a broader sense, we are trying to automate or abstract tasks with computers in order to play to their strengths for speed and accuracy.\n",
    "When coding, we prefer abstraction because it gives code a number of advantages:\n",

    "* easier to re-use\n",
    "* more robust\n",
    "* more efficient for the coder.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "IDEs are coding tools which allow you to write/test/debug your code. They offer features such as completion/insight by highlighting, resource management, debugging tools, etc. They are therefore extremely useful for development. Some of the most commonly used ones are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Spyder: bundled with the Anaconda distribution, built specifically for data science. Interface similar to RStudio/MATLAB\n",
    "2. PyCharm: also has support for JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Angular JS, Node.js, etc. Full git integration.\n",
    "3. Rodeo: *very* similar to RStudio: divided into text editor, console, environment plot/libraries/files.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12.2 Text editors\n",
    "\n",
    "Another option is to use a text editor and then execute the .py files in the command prompt/terminal. This comes in two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Edit code in a text editor (*strongly recommend Atom*)\n",
    "2. Open command window/terminal (Start > Run > \"cmd\" on Windows, Terminal on Mac/Liunux)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12.3 Consoles\n",
